This website is a portfolio/resume website which have a in-depth insight of my professional details such as skills, education, experience and qualification.

• With the help of this project, I improved and polished my web development and web designing skills.

• In this project I created, developed and designed a personalized portfolio website from scratch using HTML, CSS and some basic Javascript. I also tried to implement some features using bootstrap to introduce more user interaction and accessibility. 

• Please view the project on desktop or laptop for best viewing experience.
